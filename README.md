- Hello and welcome to my Github page!

	--About Me--

	My name is Cole, born in 1997, I work for a Canadian Municipality's Parks, Recreation and Culture department.
Since I was in middle school, I always look at software development in awe.
Being able to create your own universe inside a text document always seemed like the closest thing to real magic.
So despite the impossibly large mountain that was learning to code, I decided to set out, and get to work learning.

	--Interests--

	My motivation is to create things that improve people's quality of life, and create tools that simplify and streamline otherwise time-consuming projects
I'm a big gamer, and using that to my advantage, plan to develop small games to further my development knowledge.
I have a passion for understanding how things work at a low level. Which is why I've chosen to pursue C++, although you can expect to find a multitude of languages here.

	
	For now you can expect to find a bunch of junk here as I work through different textbooks and small projects, expanding my knowledge of git.
So thanks for stopping by!
